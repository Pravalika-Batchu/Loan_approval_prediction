# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to automate the loan approval process using machine learning algorithms, improving accuracy, speed, and transparency in the decision-making process of financial institutions.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Manual loan approval processes are time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human errors. With the increasing demand for financial services, there is a need for an automated system that can accurately predict whether a loan application should be approved.

## 🎯 Objective

Develop a machine learning model that can predict the approval status of a loan based on applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and more.
