# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to automate the loan approval process using machine learning algorithms, improving accuracy, speed, and transparency in the decision-making process of financial institutions.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Manual loan approval processes are time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human errors. With the increasing demand for financial services, there is a need for an automated system that can accurately predict whether a loan application should be approved.

## 🎯 Objective

Develop a machine learning model that can predict the approval status of a loan based on applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and more.

## 📊 Dataset
- Features include:
  - Gender
  - Married
  - Dependents
  - Education
  - Self_Employed
  - ApplicantIncome
  - CoapplicantIncome
  - LoanAmount
  - Loan_Amount_Term
  - Credit_History
  - Property_Area
  - Loan_Status (Target)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code

## 🚀 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
